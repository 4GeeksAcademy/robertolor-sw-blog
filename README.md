Star Wars Blog Reading List.

Welcome to the Star Wars Blog Reading List! This project is a minimalist version of the Star Wars Databank with a "Read Later" or "Favorites" list functionality. It was done as part of my Bootcamp experience with 4Geeks. The idea was to store data coming from a 3rd party API using the Store and then render it using different views and components.

Features:

Fetching Data: Utilizing the SWAPI.tech API, this web application fetches information about Star Wars characters, vehicles, and planets.

Display: Bootstrap components are used to present the fetched data in an organized grid format. Additional Styling is done through CSS.

Details View: Each entity includes a short description and a detailed view for more information.

Read Later Functionality: Users can save items to a "Read Later" list, accessible from anywhere in the app, using Context.

Responsive Design: The layout is designed to be responsive and easy to navigate on various devices.
